    Custom loss function for Nashâ€“Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE).

    NSE is defined as:
      NSE = 1 - (sum((y_true - y_pred)^2) / sum((y_true - mean(y_true))^2))

    Since higher NSE values are better (with a maximum of 1), we define the loss as:
      loss = 1 - NSE

    This loss function can be used in PyTorch models to encourage predictions
    that maximize the NSE.
